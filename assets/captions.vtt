What's up, my name is Dustin, and
I'm a developer here at Treehouse.

2
00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:07.822
Today, I wanna take you through using the
JavaScript array method known as includes.

3
00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:12.212
As the name suggests, this method checks
if an array includes a specific value

4
00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.808
and returns true or false respectively.

5
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:17.339
Let's hop into some code and
see how this works.

6
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.412
Make sure to check out the description or
teacher's notes 

7
00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:21.658
down below for related resources.

8
00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:23.918
If you're ready, let's get into it.

9
00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:28.086
First, let's check out the official
MDN documentation for this method.

10
00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:29.194
It's pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:33.675
According to MDN, the includes method
determines whether an array includes

12
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:38.913
a certain value among its entries,
returning true or false as appropriate.

13
00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.443
Sounds pretty simple.

14
00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:41.813
Let's practice it a bit.

15
00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:44.988
I'll open up my text editor
with an empty app.js file,

16
00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:47.212
and I'll run this file with Node.

17
00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:50.412
If you're unfamiliar with Node or
don't have it installed,

18
00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:53.557
you can run this code in your
browser's developer console.

19
00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:57.670
Let's set up a brand new array, I'll call
this names and we'll throw in some names.

20
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:08.169
Let's write jamie, kandra, and taylor.

21
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:11.314
Underneath our array,
let's write a console.log method

22
00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:17.279
and inside of that we can write our names
array and chain on our includes method.

23
00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:21.112
Inside of our includes method,
let's write the string bob.

24
00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:25.165
If I hit save and open up our terminal and
write node app.js,

25
00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:27.242
you'll see we get back false.

26
00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:30.500
And this is because bob does
not appear in our array.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.825
Let's change bob with kandra.

28
00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.482
I'll hit save and
run node app.js in my terminal again,

29
00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.867
and this time we get back true.

30
00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.590
This is because kandra
appears in our array.

31
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.598
This method is really straightforward but
can also do some complex things.

32
00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:48.876
I'll link below a video where I
use the includes method to create

33
00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:55.125
a dynamic search feature for a web app.

34
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:58.326
And that about covers it for
the includes JavaScript array method.

35
00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.806
I hope this guide helped and
I'll see you in the next one.

36
00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.425
Until then, have fun and happy coding.

         <span data-start="0.002" data-end="3.157"> 
What's up, my name is Dustin, and
I'm a developer here at Treehouse.</span> 
    <span data-start="3.157" data-end="7.822">
       
        Today, I wanna take you through using the
        JavaScript array method known as includes.
    </span>



    <span data-start="7.822" data-end="12.212">
      
        As the name suggests, this method checks
        if an array includes a specific value
    </span>
    <span data-start="12.212" data-end="14.808">
     
        and returns true or false respectively.
    </span>

    <span data-start="14.808" data-end="17.339">
        Let's hop into some code and
        see how this works.
    </span>

    <span data-start="17.339" data-end="19.412">
        Make sure to check out the description or
        teacher's notes 
    </span>

    <span data-start="19.412" data-end="21.658">
        down below for related resources.
    </span>


    <span data-start="21.658" data-end="23.918">
        If you're ready, let's get into it.
    </span>

    <span data-start="23.918" data-end="28.086">
        First, let's check out the official
        MDN documentation for this method.
    </span>

<span data-start="28.086" data-end="29.194">
    It's pretty straightforward.
</span>


<span data-start="29.194" data-end="33.675">
    According to MDN, the includes method
    determines whether an array includes
</span>


<span data-start="33.675" data-end="38.913">
    a certain value among its entries,
    returning true or false as appropriate.
</span>


<span data-start="38.913" data-end="40.443">
    Sounds pretty simple.
</span>


<span data-start="40.443" data-end="41.813">
    Let's practice it a bit.
</span>


<span data-start="41.813 " data-end="44.988">
    I'll open up my text editor
    with an empty app.js file,
</span>


<span data-start="44.988" data-end="47.212">
    and I'll run this file with Node.
</span>


<span data-start="47.212 " data-end="50.412">
    If you're unfamiliar with Node or
    don't have it installed,
</span>


<span data-start="50.412 " data-end="53.557">
    you can run this code in your
    browser's developer console.
</span>


<span data-start="53.557" data-end="57.670">
    Let's set up a brand new array, I'll call
    this names and we'll throw in some names.
</span>


<span data-start="57.670" data-end="1:08.169">
    Let's write jamie, kandra, and taylor.
</span>


<span data-start="1:08.169" data-end="1:11.314">
    Underneath our array,
    let's write a console.log method
</span>


<span data-start="1:11.314" data-end="1:17.279">
    and inside of that we can write our names
    array and chain on our includes method.
</span>


<span data-start="1:17.279" data-end="1:21.112">
    Inside of our includes method,
    let's write the string bob.
</span>


<span data-start="1:21.112" data-end="1:25.165">
    If I hit save and open up our terminal and
    write node app.js,
</span>


<span data-start="1:25.165" data-end="00:01:27.242">
    you'll see we get back false.
</span>


<span data-start="1:27.242" data-end="1:30.500">
    And this is because bob does
    not appear in our array.
</span>


<span data-start="1:30.500" data-end="1:32.825">
    Let's change bob with kandra.
</span>


<span data-start="1:32.825" data-end="1:36.482">
    I'll hit save and
    run node app.js in my terminal again,
</span>


<span data-start="1:36.482" data-end="1:38.867"> 
    and this time we get back true.
</span>


<span data-start="1:38.867 " data-end="1:41.590">
    This is because kandra
    appears in our array.
</span>


<span data-start="1:41.590" data-end="1:45.598">
    This method is really straightforward but
    can also do some complex things.
</span>


<span data-start="1:45.598" data-end="1:48.876">
    I'll link below a video where I
    use the includes method to create
</span>


<span data-start="1:48.876" data-end="1:55.125">
    a dynamic search feature for a web app.
</span>


<span data-start="1:55.125" data-end="1:58.326">
    And that about covers it for
    the includes JavaScript array method.
</span>


<span data-start="1:58.326" data-end="2:00.806">
    I hope this guide helped and
    I'll see you in the next one.
</span>


<span data-start="2:00.806" data-end="2:04.425">
    Until then, have fun and happy coding.

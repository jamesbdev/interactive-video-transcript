    <p>   
         <span> 
What's up, my name is Dustin, and
I'm a developer here at Treehouse.</span> 
    <span>
       
        Today, I wanna take you through using the
        JavaScript array method known as includes.
    </span>



    <span>
      
        As the name suggests, this method checks
        if an array includes a specific value
    </span>




    <span>
     
        and returns true or false respectively.
    </span>



    <span>
        Let's hop into some code and
        see how this works.
    </span>




    <span>
        Make sure to check out the description or
        teacher's notes 
    </span>




    <span>
        down below for related resources.
    </span>




    <span>
        If you're ready, let's get into it.
    </span>




    <span>
        First, let's check out the official
        MDN documentation for this method.
    </span>



<span>
    It's pretty straightforward.
</span>


<span>
    According to MDN, the includes method
    determines whether an array includes
</span>


<span>
    a certain value among its entries,
    returning true or false as appropriate.
</span>


<span>
    Sounds pretty simple.
</span>


<span>
    Let's practice it a bit.
</span>


<span>
    I'll open up my text editor
    with an empty app.js file,
</span>


<span>
    and I'll run this file with Node.
</span>


<span>
    If you're unfamiliar with Node or
    don't have it installed,
</span>


<span>
    you can run this code in your
    browser's developer console.
</span>


<span>
    Let's set up a brand new array, I'll call
    this names and we'll throw in some names.
</span>


<span>
    Let's write jamie, kandra, and taylor.
</span>


<span>
    Underneath our array,
    let's write a console.log method
</span>


<span>
    and inside of that we can write our names
    array and chain on our includes method.
</span>


<span>
    Inside of our includes method,
    let's write the string bob.
</span>


<span>
    If I hit save and open up our terminal and
    write node app.js,
</span>


<span>
    you'll see we get back false.
</span>


<span>
    And this is because bob does
    not appear in our array.
</span>


<span>
    Let's change bob with kandra.
</span>


<span>
    I'll hit save and
    run node app.js in my terminal again,
</span>


<span>
    and this time we get back true.
</span>


<span>
    This is because kandra
    appears in our array.
</span>


<span>
    This method is really straightforward but
    can also do some complex things.
</span>


<span>
    I'll link below a video where I
    use the includes method to create
</span>


<span>
    a dynamic search feature for a web app.
</span>


<span>
    And that about covers it for
    the includes JavaScript array method.
</span>


<span>
    I hope this guide helped and
    I'll see you in the next one.
</span>


<span>
    Until then, have fun and happy coding.
